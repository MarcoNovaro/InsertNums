# Sublime Text - InsertNums
Sublime Text plugin, that inserts consecutive numbers across multiple selections.

## Compatibility
After quick testing, InsertNums is compatible with ST2 and ST3!

## Installation
For now, download the Zip and copy it to your Sublime Text Packages folder, or use `git clone`. I'll make a pull request shortly to add it to Package Control.

## Usage

- **Windows**: CTRL+Alt+N
- **OSX**: Super+Alt+N
- **Linux**: CTRL+Alt+N

By default, InsertNums will use `1 1 1` as the default settings. These values relate to:

- Starting number - where to start the iterator at
- Step - how much to increment each iteration by
- Padding - will prepend a `0` to the number in the iteration.
